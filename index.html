            <p class="sec1p">Bikes have been invtented in 1817 and have since been a genious invention. First ever bike, however, looked nothing like todays fancy bikes. The first bike ever made is similar to the one that you see on the picture on the right side of the page. Crazy, right? Since the moment of invention, bicycles have inspired development of similar products, such as smaller carts, unicycles and more. Initially the bike was used only as a form of transportation, which is understandable, as that huge thing is not really manueverable.</p>

            <p class="sec1p">There are many different types of bikes that are catered to different set of people. For example, there are road bikes for proffesional road cycling, and for recreational as well. There are mountain bikes, there are kids bikes, electric bikes and so on. You might get confused from all these names, but dont worry, everyone does get confused. All these bikes are also used for different activities, and it is not acceptable to use wrong bike for wrong purpose. So make sure you use your bike according to its purpose, as you may damage/total the bike if you do wrong activities with it.</p>

            <p class="sec1p">Same as with bike types, there are different types of clothing for different cycling activities. For example, you will have more relaxed protective clothing when you are doing mountain biking, and you will have aerodynamic clothing if you are doing road cycling. The clothing only matters if you are doing the sport proffesionally, as you dont really need top-tier aerodynamic clothing for just after-school cycling. </p>
