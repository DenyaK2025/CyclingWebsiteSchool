                <p class="boxp">Mountain biking is by far the most common type of cycling. Actually, more than 50% of the people who cycle own a mountain bike. Mountain bikes are comfortable to ride on thanks to the 2 or 1 point suspensions, many gears to choose from, and more comfortable seating position than on road bikes. This allows a road bike to be a solid choice for those who do not want to do road cycling proffesionally. Mountain biking is self explanatory. You can use your bike to ride on paved surfaces, yes, but the strength of mtb bike is that it can endure the forces and surfaces of a mountaneous terrain and huge jumps. This is the advantage of having a mountain bike, as you do not have to worry about accidently breaking it by riding on dirt. </p>

                <P class="boxpalt">Once you know how the mountain bike looks, you will be able to recognise it anytyime any day. The main characteristics to look for are suspensions and a frame form. Usually, mountain bike will have a front wheel suspension, which will look like a giant fork, and on more expensive bikes, you will also see one suspension below your seat. Sometimes the suspension have coils on them, and sometimes not. As well, You will have wheels. On mtb, wheels are usually big in width, and big in diamater. They use hydraulic brakes mainly, so you will see a small aluminum circle at the center of the wheel. The frame will look comfortable and relaxed.</P>
