             When choosing the type of bike, you must consider different factors, such as where you will be riding, and what purpose are you going to be riding for. If you will be riding on rocky/uneven surface, proffesionally or relaxed, I would reccomend going with MTB. If you're only going to be riding on paved road, I would go with a Road bike. If you are using bike to go around a city, I would use a city bike type thing.

            Getting a right size for a bike could be hard sometimes, and sometimes not. Usually, you dont have to look at the size chart to pick yourself a bike. Really, it depends on how comfortable you're sitting on it. IF you are comfortable on your bike, I would reccomend getting that size even if the size chart says otherwise

            Spend more time learning the correct technique for your style of cycling. Everyone who knows basics can ride a bike. However, Not everyone can ACTUALLY ride a bike correctly. What you will do is either go to a specialized areas that do your type of cycling, or you learn the technique yourself via Youtube. Knowing the technique will help you to be more comfortable on a bike and get tired less often, and make you excited for next activities

            Safety should be your N1 priority while doing either type of cycling. On the road, you always have to be looking around and dont do unexpected movements, as cars can hit you and potentially unalive you. While mountain biking, you should never over-estimate your abilities and do trails/jumps that are far beyond your ability to avoid injuries. Also you shall wear appropriate gear at all times, as it can potentially save your life one day!
